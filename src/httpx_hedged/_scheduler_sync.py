"""Sync counterpart to ``_scheduler.HedgeScheduler``, for ``SyncHedgedTransport``.

Same race-then-cancel shape as the async scheduler, but built on
``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`` instead of ``asyncio.create_task``,
since a sync ``httpx.Client`` has no event loop to schedule coroutines on.

The one real behavioral difference from the async scheduler: a losing OS
thread blocked on a socket read cannot be interrupted the way
``asyncio.Task.cancel()`` interrupts a coroutine at its next ``await``. So
unlike the async scheduler (which always resolves the loser, by cancelling
and awaiting it, before returning), this scheduler returns the winner's
result immediately and lets the loser finish in the background whenever its
blocking call happens to return, discarding its result via a done-callback
at that point. ``loser_future.cancel()`` is still attempted first, but it
only succeeds if the loser is still queued and hasn't started running yet
(e.g. it never got a worker thread before losing) — once a thread is mid
socket-read, cancellation is a no-op.

This means hedging through this scheduler *without a request timeout
configured on the inner transport is unsafe*: a losing primary or hedge with
no timeout can block its worker thread forever, and enough of those
piling up exhausts the thread pool. Always pair this with an
``httpx.Timeout`` on the wrapped client/transport.
